# KL/SELANGOR RENTAL PREDICTION USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION AND TREES MODELS

**Problem statement**

When it comes to setting up a rental price or giving out indications, homeowners, valuers, or realtors, tend to rely on the internet to check the rental market rate from property websites such as PropertyGuru, mudah.my, iProperty, and many others. As easy as it may sound, “the inconsistency of information can easily be found in websites as most of the residential property providers did not own its property data. The objective of most residential property web is more focused on providing a platform for users to share their information. Thus, inconsistent information occurs due to different sets of data may not be entered by the same person (Kee Li Yap, 2020). One can choose their preferred rate suitable for their home from the property websites, but how can one assured on the accuracy of the price per the property’s features? Under-pricing can result in a loss of income, while on the other hand, overpricing can make it difficult to rent the property and lose out on a suitable customer base. It is, therefore, crucial to examine the rental price carefully and suggest a fair rental rate that reflects the property’s value (Dong Xue Ying, 2023).

This project will adopt Classification model, hence, we will focus on the rental category instead of a price. 

**Dataset**

In this project, I will use a high-rise housing dataset obtained from Kaggel. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ariewijaya/rent-pricing-kuala-lumpur-malaysia). This project utilises Jupyter Notebook Python for the entire modeling process.

**Algorithms and Metrics**

Commonly used models for predicting housing rental include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting algorithms. The evaluation of all models will be using the Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, F1 score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, and ROC AUC.
The models will be trained in 3 ways, by default, with parameter and with GridSearchCV. The models with highest score will be selacted as the best model for prediction.

**Purpose**

This project is for study only. Caution must be taken as the information/technique used in this project may not be accurate or done in the right way. Also, credits to all the people for the sources used in this project.
